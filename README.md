## Team
* Shengfu Zhang
* Ziqi Tang

## Iterations 1
* We used book project as the boilerplate code and build our projects on top of that.
* We found the Animal Crossing New Horizon product spreadsheet dataset and use Json 
parse tool to load into the MongoDB Altas cluster.
* We created new schemas for different queries for our Animal Crossing products and the CRUD operations.
* We added new APIs for CRUD operations in our API server.
* For UI server, we added pages for our product category lists. The user profile page is still under construction.
